# Grant support

The ANU's Statistical Support Network (SSN) provides collaborative support to researchers submitting grant funding applications. Discussions around issues such as sample size, study design and analysis plans are best held early in the application process so that projects are neither so small that they lack power, nor so big that they are infeasible. 

The SSN also strongly suggests that funding applications include a budget line for statistical support, to ensure continued collaboration throughout the life of the project.
